# Flashcard App

My version of Tutplus Modern Web Apps with React and Redux app

The URL for this is found [here](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/modern-web-apps-with-react-and-redux/lessons/set-up-the-project) and requires a subscription to view

## Build Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install
2. To build the app type run: `npm run build`
3. To run the local server: `npm run server`

## Current Issues

I'm getting an TypeError on the `refs` property on the `input` field
